# Supermarket Queuing System Simulator ðŸ›’

This is a simulation project built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** as part of a university course on Simulation. It models a **supermarket queuing system** and provides three main functionalities to analyze service behavior based on various queueing models.

## ðŸ“‚ Features

### 1. **General Simulation**
- Based on **M/M/N** queuing model
- Uses exponential distribution for arrival and service times
- User inputs:  
  - Mean Arrival Time  
  - Mean Service Time  
  - Number of Servers  

### 2. **Priority-Based Simulation**
- Also follows **M/M/N**
- Adds priority mechanism to queue handling
- User inputs are the same as general simulation

### 3. **Queuing Calculator**
- Lets you choose among:
  - **M/M/N**
  - **M/G/N**
  - **G/G/N**
- More flexible modeling (G = General/any other distribution)
- Calculates performance measures based on inputs
